# Quadratic Equation Solver 3.0
This lightweight program solves a quadratic equation entered by the user in a console window. It can list the following attributes of a quadratic equation:
* All roots: x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>
* The discriminant (b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac)
* The turning point of the parabola.
* The y-intercept of the parabola.

## Downloads
_Note: An executable file only exists for Windows versions._<br><br>
**If you have Python installed and have experience with the language:**
1. Download the source code from `quadratic_solver.py`.
2. You're done. The program can be run with Python straight away, but it's best to be run in a console window with the command `py quadratic_solver.py`.

**If you don't have Python (Windows only):**
1. Check the Releases section of the repository.
2. Click on the latest (probably the only) published release.
3. Download the `.exe` file in the specified release.

## Notes
1. I don't accept any PRs to this repository. It's just a simple quadratic equation solver.<br>
2. If you wish to download the source code and test it, the oldest Python version that this will run on is 3.6.
